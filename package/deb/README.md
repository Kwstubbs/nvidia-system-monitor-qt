# deb package builder

You can build your own deb package or use a pre-built one (see [releases](https://github.com/congard/nvidia-system-monitor-qt/releases)).

If you want to build a package on your own, follow these steps:

1. Edit `config.py` if you need
2. Execute `sudo python3 build.py`

The package will appear in the current directory.
